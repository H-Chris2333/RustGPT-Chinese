[![Check](https://github.com/H-Chris233/RustGPT-Chinese/actions/workflows/check.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/H-Chris233/RustGPT-Chinese/actions/workflows/check.yml) [![Test](https://github.com/H-Chris233/RustGPT-Chinese/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/H-Chris233/RustGPT-Chinese/actions/workflows/test.yml)

**[中文！](README_zh.md)**

A complete **Chinese-Supported Large Language Model implementation in pure Rust** with no external ML frameworks. Built from the ground up using only `ndarray` for matrix operations, featuring a modern **Pre-LN Transformer architecture** (GPT-2 standard).

## 🚀 What This Is

This project demonstrates how to build a transformer-based language model from scratch in Rust that supports Chinese language processing, including:

- **Modern Pre-LN Transformer Architecture** - GPT-2/3 standard with explicit residual connections
- **Pre-training** on Chinese factual text completion
- **Instruction tuning** for Chinese conversational AI
- **Interactive chat mode** for Chinese language testing
- **Full backpropagation** with gradient clipping and Adam optimizer
- **Modular architecture** with clean separation of concerns
- **Chinese-optimized tokenization** using jieba-rs with global singleton optimization (50-70% faster)
- **Multi-head self-attention mechanism** (8 heads) for better Chinese grammar understanding
- **Context window management** for maintaining conversation history
- **Advanced decoding methods** (top-k/top-p sampling, beam search, temperature scaling)
- **Regularization techniques** (Dropout, Layer Normalization) for improved stability
- **Performance monitoring** with detailed timing and profiling

## ❌ What This Isn't

This is not a production grade Chinese LLM. It is so far away from the larger Chinese models.

This is just a toy project that demonstrates how Chinese LLMs work under the hood.

## 🔍 Key Files to Explore

Start with these core files to understand the implementation:

- **[`src/main.rs`](src/main.rs)** - Training pipeline, data preparation, and interactive mode
- **[`src/llm.rs`](src/llm.rs)** - Core LLM implementation and training logic
- **[`src/transformer.rs`](src/transformer.rs)** - Pre-LN Transformer block with explicit residual connections

## 🏗️ Architecture

The model uses a **Pre-LN Transformer architecture** (GPT-2 standard) with the following components:

```
Input Text → Tokenization (supports Chinese with jieba-rs) → Token Embeddings + Positional Encoding
    ↓
[2x Transformer Blocks] ← Optimized for small datasets
    Each block:
    • LayerNorm → Multi-Head Attention (8 heads) → Dropout → Residual Connection
    • LayerNorm → Feed-Forward Network → Dropout → Residual Connection
    ↓
Output Projection → Softmax → Token Predictions
```

### Why Pre-LN Transformer?

Pre-LN (Layer Normalization before sub-layers) is the modern standard used in GPT-2, GPT-3, and beyond:
- ✅ **More stable training** - Better gradient flow
- ✅ **Faster convergence** - Reduced gradient vanishing/explosion
- ✅ **More robust** - Less sensitive to learning rate

**Architecture Comparison:**

```

## 🧪 What The Model Learns

The implementation includes training phases that support Chinese:

1. **Pre-training**: Can learn world knowledge from Chinese factual statements
   - "太阳从东方升起，在西方落下"
   - "水由于重力而从高处流向低处"
   - "山脉是高大而多岩石的地形"
   - Enhanced with Chinese cultural knowledge, idioms, and historical facts

2. **Instruction Tuning**: Can learn Chinese conversational patterns
   - "用户：山脉是如何形成的？助手：山脉通过构造力或火山活动在长时间的地质时期内形成..."
   - Handles Chinese greetings, explanations, and follow-up questions
   - Incorporates Chinese cultural references and idioms

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Clone and run
git clone https://github.com/H-Chris233/RustGPT-Chinese.git
cd RustGPT-Chinese
cargo run

# The model will:
# 1. Build vocabulary from Chinese training data (with jieba-rs tokenization support)
# 2. Pre-train on Chinese factual statements (500 epochs, optimized for small datasets)
# 3. Instruction-tune on Chinese conversational data (500 epochs)
# 4. Enter interactive mode for Chinese testing
```

### Performance Tips

For maximum performance, use release mode:
```bash
cargo build --release
./target/release/llm
```

Release mode enables:
- **Link-time optimization (LTO)** - Cross-crate inlining
- **Maximum optimization level** (opt-level 3)
- **Single codegen unit** - Better optimization opportunities
- **Expected speedup**: 10-20% over debug mode

## 🎮 Interactive Mode

After training, test the model interactively with Chinese:

```
Enter prompt: 山脉是如何形成的?
Model output: 山脉通过构造力或火山活动在长时间的地质时期内形成

Enter prompt: 降雨的原因是什么?
Model output: 降雨是由云中的水蒸气凝结成水滴，当水滴变得太重而无法悬浮在空气中时形成的
```
